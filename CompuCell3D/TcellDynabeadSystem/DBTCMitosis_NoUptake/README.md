This folder contains the Simulation codes of an initial trial simulation of T cell population growth.
In this code T cell division is permitted if the system remains under a pressure threshold of 70 simulation units, with no restrictions on maximum division numbers. 
No nutrient field is applied.
The simulation video can also be found in https://youtube.com/shorts/LxbRp75bbMM?feature=share
