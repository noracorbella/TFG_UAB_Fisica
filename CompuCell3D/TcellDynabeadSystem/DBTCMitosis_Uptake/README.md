This repository contains the parameter exploration results for T cell Dynabead system simulations. 
1. **Simulations 1-3**
   - Low/zero nutrient replenishment
   - Restrictive uptake rates
   - No activation advantages
   - Limited division capacity (5 max divisions)

2. **Simulations 4-7**
   - High nutrient replenishment rates
   - Strong activation advantages
   - Relaxed division limits 8-10 max divisions
   - Optimized for sigmoid curve generation

3. **System Boundary Testing (Simulations 8-10)**
   - Alternative growth dynamics exploration
