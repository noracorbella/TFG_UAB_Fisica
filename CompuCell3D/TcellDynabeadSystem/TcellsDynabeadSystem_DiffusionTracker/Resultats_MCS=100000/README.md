This directory contains the results of CompuCell3D simulations for the T cell-Dynabead system after 100,000 Monte Carlo Steps (MCS).

*   **Dynabead_x_vs_mcs_MCS=100000.png**: Plot showing a randomly chosen Dynabead's x-position over MCS.
*   **TCell_fluctuations_analysis_MCS=100000.png**: Histogram depicting the distribution of T cell position fluctuations around their average positions. The graph shows a Gaussian curve, characteristic of Brownian motion, which is typical for the random movements of cells in this type of system.
*   **Tcell_x_vs_mcs_MCS=100000.png**: Plot illustrating a randomly chosen  T cell's x-position over MCS.
*   **cell_positions_MCS=100000.png**:Trajecotry followed by the T cells and Dynabeads along the 100,000 MCS. 
*   **cell_positions_MCS=100000.txt**: Text file containing numerical data of the positions of cells over at 100,000 MCS.
